# Instructions

Welcome to your first React project! It's a lot to take in,
but try not to get overwhelmed. For this lesson, you 
only need to focus on 'App.jsx' and 'Bar.jsx', which 
is in the 'components' directory.

You will need to reformat the following HTML code
into a React component named `Bar`:
```
  <div class="topnav">
    <a class="active" href="#home">Home</a>
    <a href="#about">About</a>
    <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />
  </div>
```

This component should use the styling already created in the
'Bar.css' file. Once you have created the component in 'Bar.jsx'
and included the component inside 'App.jsx', you should be
able to see a basic navigation bar with three tabs and a 
simple search bar.
